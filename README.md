#A simple payment checkout
Here is my example of Cams assignment to build a simple checkout that is userfriendly on all devices.
I focused on having choices along the way that would render the screen in different ways, hopefully keeping the customers interest. I am using polymer and geolocation just to test it out.

This is by no mean a fully functional checkout page, and there are still things to do, but you get the picture.

###To see it in action: 
Type the following adress in your browser: http://lhellborg.github.io/simpleCheckout/

I have not made src and dest file and I have also kept the bower_components in the github repository, just so you can see the page by loading the adress above.
